Singly Linked List:
Structure: A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
Operations:
Insertion: Adding a new node to the beginning, middle, or end.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Accessing each node in sequence from the head to the end.
Characteristics:
One-way traversal.
Simplicity and lower memory usage compared to doubly linked lists.
Doubly Linked List:
Structure: Each node contains a data field, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Operations:
Insertion: Adding a new node to the beginning, middle, or end.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Can be traversed in both directions (forward and backward).
Characteristics:
Two-way traversal.
More complex than singly linked lists.
Requires more memory due to the additional reference.
