Understand Recursive Algorithms
Concept of Recursion
Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It simplifies certain problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that resemble the original problem. Each recursive call processes a smaller portion of the problem until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that stops further recursion.

Benefits of Recursion
Simplifies Complex Problems: Makes code easier to understand and maintain by solving problems in a more natural, straightforward manner.
Divide and Conquer: Breaks down a problem into smaller, easier-to-solve sub-problems.
Backtracking: Useful in scenarios like searching and sorting, where multiple paths or solutions need to be explored.


Setup
Method to Calculate Future Value Using a Recursive Approach
Let's create a method to predict the future value based on past data and growth rates. The recursive formula we'll use is:

Future¬†Value=Present¬†Value√ó(1+Growth¬†Rate)ùëõ
 
where n is the number of periods into the future.


Analysis
Time Complexity
The time complexity of this recursive algorithm is 
O(n), where n is the number of periods. This is because each recursive call reduces the number of periods by one until it reaches the base case.
