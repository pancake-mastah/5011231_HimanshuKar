Optimizing the Recursive Solution
Recursive solutions can lead to excessive computation and stack overflow issues if not optimized. Two common optimization techniques are:
Memoization: Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
Iterative Approach: Convert the recursion to an iterative solution to save stack space.
