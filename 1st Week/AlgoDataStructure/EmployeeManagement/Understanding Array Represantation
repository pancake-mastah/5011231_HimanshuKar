o	Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.

The representation of an array can be defined by its declaration. A declaration means allocating memory for an array of a given size.
Arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration or later using a loop or individually.
Example:
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

Arrays help to increase code optimization.
It helps in ordering and indexing data structure to store a particular type of element.
It can also store variables and objects of class.
Every element of an array is held in a definite memory location.
