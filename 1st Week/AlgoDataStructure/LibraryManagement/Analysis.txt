Analysis
Time Complexity
Linear Search: O(n) - Searches each element until it finds the target.
Binary Search: O(log n) - Efficiently narrows down the search range by half each time.
When to Use Each Algorithm:
Linear Search: Suitable for small or unsorted lists where the overhead of sorting is not justified.
Binary Search: Suitable for large, sorted lists where the initial sorting overhead is justified by the faster search time.
