Understand Search Algorithms
Linear Search:
Description: Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list until the target element is found or the list ends.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
Use Case: Suitable for small or unsorted lists.
Binary Search:
Description: Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
Use Case: Suitable for large, sorted lists.
