Analysis
Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Product:

The addProduct method involves adding a product to the HashMap.
Time Complexity: O(1) on average because HashMap provides constant time for insertion.

Update Product:

The updateProduct method involves checking if the product exists and then updating it.
Time Complexity: O(1) on average for the same reason as above.

Delete Product:

The deleteProduct method involves removing a product from the HashMap.
Time Complexity: O(1) on average, as removal also has constant time complexity in HashMap.
