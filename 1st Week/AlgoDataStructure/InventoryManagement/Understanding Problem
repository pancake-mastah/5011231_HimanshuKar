1.	Understand the Problem:
o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.


Data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories for several reasons:

Efficiency in Data Storage:

Optimal Use of Memory: Efficient data structures such as HashMaps, Trees, or Arrays help minimize memory usage by storing only necessary information in a compact form.
Scalability: They allow the system to scale seamlessly as the inventory grows, managing larger volumes of data without significant performance degradation.

Scalability and Performance:

Handling Large Datasets: Algorithms and data structures are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring that the inventory system can manage millions of products without significant performance hits.
Parallel Processing: Advanced data structures and algorithms support parallel processing and distributed computing, allowing the inventory system to leverage multi-core processors and distributed systems to handle large inventories efficiently.
