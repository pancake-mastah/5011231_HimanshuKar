Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time complexity. It characterizes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time or space it requires as a function of the input size.

Purpose: It helps in understanding how the performance of an algorithm scales with increasing input sizes, allowing developers to predict and optimize performance.
General Form: 
O(f(n)), where 
f(n) is a function representing the growth rate of the algorithm's running time or space usage as the input size n grows.

How It Helps in Analyzing Algorithms:

Comparative Analysis: Allows comparison of different algorithms to determine which one is more efficient for a given problem.
Scalability Assessment: Helps in predicting how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows, facilitating the design of scalable systems.
Performance Optimization: Identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies, guiding improvements to enhance the algorithmâ€™s performance.
